### Asteroid Clustering Project

- **Dataset Source:**  
  Kaggle - containing data on various asteroids observed in the sky over the past few years.
  
- **Dataset Features:**  
  - Types of asteroids
  - Sizes of asteroids
  - Shapes of asteroids

- **Goal:**  
  Cluster the asteroids based on their attributes to identify patterns and groupings.

- **Main Algorithm Used:**  
  MiniBatch K-Means Algorithm

- **Key Steps in the Project:**  
  1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
  2. Feature selection and scaling
  3. Applying MiniBatch K-Means for clustering
  4. Visualizing and interpreting the clusters

- **Tools & Libraries:**  
  Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn

- **Expected Outcome:**  
  Insightful clustering of asteroids based on their characteristics to provide a better understanding of their distribution and group behavior.
